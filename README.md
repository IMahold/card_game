# Task Description

The company XYZ is interested in creating a card game for which they need your help. What they
would like to do is to have two teams (Red and Blue). The user, upon opening the website, selects
one of the teams. Your task is to create 25 random creatures with the following traits [Name,
Pictures, Hit point] for both teams.
NOTE:
Name: Search for an API that would generate a random name for you
Picture: See below,
Hit Point: Create your own generator function in which you use the built in libraries.

On click of a button the battle between the teams should begin. First display your creature traits
on the cards. You should be able to randomly choose a card from your s_deck and a
card from the opposite s_deck. As soon as both cards are selected, display the traits of the opposite
card. If your hit point > selected hit point, you win that card, otherwise you lose your own (even
if your hit point = selected hit point). In either scenario, the count of the b_decks must change.
You, as the user, also have the option of editing a card's trait only once. The change must be
appealable immediately on the screen. Save the win / lose score in a global state and persist it so
that every time the user refreshes the score is shown, even if the game restarts.
